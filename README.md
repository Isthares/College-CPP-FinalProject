# College CPP Final Project
## Description: *Word Ladder Game*

The Word Ladder Game begins with two words. The user enters a start word and an end word. The program changes the start word into the end word progressively, creating an existing word at each step. Each step consists of a single letter substitution. 

For example, the following are some of the possible solutions between words "LOVE" and "HATE":
- LOVE  HOVE  HAVE  HATE 
- LOVE  LAVE  LATE  HATE 
- LOVE  COVE  CAVE  HAVE  HATE
- LOVE  COVE  CAVE  CAKE  HAKE  HATE
